Analysis
=======
tobac provides several analysis functions that allow for the calculation of important quantities based on the tracking results. This includes the calculation of important properties of the tracked objects such as cloud lifetimes, cloud areas/volumes, but also allows for a convenient calculation of statistics for arbitratry fields of the same shape as as the input data used for the tracking analysis.
