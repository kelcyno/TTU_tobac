#FEATURE PARAMETERS

# Dictionary containing keyword options (could also be directly given to the function)
parameters_features={}

parameters_features['position_threshold']='weighted_diff'
parameters_features['sigma_threshold']= 1.0 #0.5 is the default
parameters_features['threshold']= 30 
#parameters_features['min_num']=0
#parameters_features['min_distance']=5 #0 #15
#parameters_features['n_erosion_threshold']=0
#parameters_features['n_min_threshold']=0


#SIGMA_THRESHOLD
The default for sigma_threshold is 0.5, in practice this produces many more features
than is realistic in some instances. TTU currently uses 1.0, but if you find you aren't 
capturing the features you'd like, lower this values.


#THRESHOLD
This is the tracking threshold. There is the option in tobac for multiple thresholds,
however for tracking on composite reflectivity, TTU uses 10dBz or 30dBz.

#MIN_NUM
This is the minimum number of features, we set 0

#MIN_DISTANCE
The minimum allowable distance between features. We have varied this from 0-5, I believe 
this is in grid elements or model units. This has not had an appreciable difference on
isolated convection.

#N_EROSION_THRESHOLD
TTU does not use this parameter currently, the tobac default is used.

#N_MIN_THRESHOLD
TTU does not use this parameter currently, the tobac default is used.



#SEGMENTATION PARAMETERS

# Dictionary containing keyword arguments for segmentation step:
parameters_segmentation={}
parameters_segmentation['method']='watershed'
parameters_segmentation['threshold']=30  
parameters_segmentation['ISO_dilate']=10  
#parameters_segmentation['features']
#parameters_segmentation['field']
#parameters_segmentation['dxy']
#parameters_segmentation['target']
#parameters_segmentation['level']
#parameters_segmentation['max_distance']
#parameters_segmentation['vertical_coord']


#METHOD
watershed is the default and what TTU uses.

#THRESHOLD
We set this threshold to match the feature threshold

#ISO_dilate
This is the dilation parameter for how much the segmentation mask shape is dilated.
The default is 8, but also configurable. This is in grid boxes. Larger value is a larger dilation.

#MAXIMUM DISTANCE
Maximum distance from a marker allowed to be classified as
belonging to that cell. Default is None.


#TRACKING PARAMETERS

# Dictionary containing keyword arguments for the linking step:
parameters_linking={}
parameters_linking['stubs'] = 3
parameters_linking['method_linking']='predict'
parameters_linking['adaptive_stop']=0.2
parameters_linking['adaptive_step']=0.95
parameters_linking['extrapolate']=2 
parameters_linking['order']=2 
parameters_linking['subnetwork_size']=100 
parameters_linking['memory']= 2
#parameters_linking['time_cell_min']=1
parameters_linking['v_max']=1.0 
parameters_linking['d_min']= None 


#STUBS
Stubby tracks with frames fewer than this threshold will be removed. TTU varies this
between 3 and 5.

#METHOD LINKING
TTU uses predict, I *think* this is default.

#ADATPTIVE STOP/STEP
TTU USES 0.2 (STOP), and 0.95 (STEP) from the tobac examples. Have not varied this 
parameter significantly.

#EXTRAPOLATE
The number of frames to extrapolate the track forward to

#ORDER
Order of polynomial for extrapolating
The number of frames which a feature will remain in a track without 

#SUBNETWORK SIZE
This is related to the area in which related cells in the next frame are examined for 
linking. TTU has varied this at 50-100. Currently using 100.

#MEMORY
The number of frames which a feature will be kept in a track (in the track 'memory') when
a feature may not be found in the next frame. TTU uses 2, but have used anything from 1-5.

#TIME CELL MIN
Minimum cell duration. The minimum here (I believe is) 1 frame.

#V MAX
This has a significant impact on how well and how realistic the track is. This is roughly the 
velocity of the cell you might be tracking. Unsure of units. If you have unreasonable or 
unrealistic cell tracks (90 degree turns etc) consider increasing or decreasing this variable.
A value of 1.0 (or lower) is appropriate for Houston storms which are relatively isolated
and stagnant. SE storms often require a value of 2-2.5, some stagnant days in Houston have
been tracked well with values of 0.5.

#D min
This field is the minimum search distance for the next feature in the track. This is used 
in place of giving the v_max parameter. TTU uses the v_max parameter and uses the default values
of None here.
